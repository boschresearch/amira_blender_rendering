Contributing
============

Want to contribute? That's great! Any contribution is welcome, e.g. documentation, bug reports,
feature request/implementations etc. 
You can contribute code or documentation through the standard GitHub pull request model.
For large contributions we do encourage you to file a ticket in the GitHub issue tracking system
prior to any development to coordinate with the ABR development team early in the process.
Coordinating up front helps to avoid frustration later on.

For additional information about how to contribute and the legal requirements,  
please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md notice file located at the root directory of the project repo.


Short Guidelines
----------------

In short:
- Either contact us; or
- Open an issue in the project Issue Tracker. While doing so please provide:
    1. a meaningful title;
    2. a meaningful (concise and clear) description with the minimum amount of necessary info
    either to replicate the issue or to describe what the requested should provide. 


**NOTE** 
According to AMIRA Blender Rendering license clause, your contribution must be licensed as Apache-2.0.
