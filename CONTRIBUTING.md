Contributing
============

Want to contribute? That's great! Any contribution is welcome, e.g. documentation, bug reports,
feature request/implementations etc. 
You can contribute code or documentation through the standard GitHub pull request model.
For large contributions we do encourage you to file a ticket in the GitHub issue tracking system
prior to any development to coordinate with the ABR development team early in the process.
Coordinating up front helps to avoid frustration later on.
