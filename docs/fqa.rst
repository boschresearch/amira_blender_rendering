Frequently Questioned Answers
=============================

1. **Why is ABR a command line script, and not a blender GUI plugin?**

   The intended usage of ABR is to 1) setup scenarios and models in blender, and
   2) then run rendering of an entire dataset on a headless GPU cluster. Hence,
   the focus was primarily on writing the scripts that are required to automate
   the rendering process given a certain scenario.

   Note that we might add a blender GUI plugin at some point in the future.

2. **I really love ABR!**

   Thanks, that's great to hear! If you see one of us at a conference, you might
   say thanks in person or buy us a beer or three ;-)

3. **I do not like ABR!**

   Well, that's a bummer. Let us know what exactly you did not like, so that we
   can improve on it.

4. **If I need help, how can I get in contact with ABR's developers?**
