Contributing to AMIRA Blender Rendering
=======================================


Want to contribute? That's great! Any contribution is welcome!
You can do that by:

* :ref:`Submitting Issues` in the GitHub issue tracking system
* :ref:`Contributing Code` using the standard GitHub pull request model

For large contributions we do encourage you to :ref:`file a ticket<Submitting Issues>` 
in the GitHub issue tracking system prior to any development to coordinate with 
the ABR development team early in the process.
Coordinating up front helps to avoid frustration later on.

Also, in case you need help and/or support you can always :ref:`contact us<Contacts>`.

Finally, you can also fork and work on your own but we discourage this operating mode
unless rather than contributing you aim at developing your own cool project based on ABR.
