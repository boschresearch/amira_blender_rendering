Contributing to AMIRA Blender Rendering
=======================================

In case you feel like contributing to ABR you are more than welcome.
Our preferred ways (in increasing order ;-)) to do so are:

* :ref:`Submit Issues`
* :ref:`Contributing Code`

Also, in case you need help and/or support you can always contact us.

Finally, you can also fork and work on your own but we highly
discourage this unless rather than contributing you aim at developing
your own cool project based on ABR.
