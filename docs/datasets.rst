Datasets
========

ABR's main purpose is to render datasets. For instance, we used it to render the
PhIRM dataset, which consists of several scenarios. They are described in more
detail below.

If you also rendered a dataset and made it publicly available, please drop us a
note and a description of the dataset. We will then add it to the list of
datasets and descriptions below.

Currently we provide the following list of datasets:
