# Contributing to AMIRA Blender Rendering

Want to contribute? That's great! Any contribution is welcome!
You can do that by:

* [Submitting Issues](#issues) in the GitHub issue tracking system
* [Contributing Code](#code) using the standard GitHub pull request model

For large contributions we do encourage you to file a [ticket](#issues)
in the GitHub issue tracking system prior to any development to coordinate with
the ABR development team early in the process.
Coordinating up front helps to avoid frustration later on.

Also, in case you need help and/or support you can always [contact](./index.md#contacts) us.

Finally, you can also fork and work on your own but we discourage this operating mode
unless rather than contributing you aim at developing your own cool project based on ABR.

For additional information about how to contribute and the legal requirements,
please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md notice file located at the root directory of the project repo.

**NOTE** : According to AMIRA Blender Rendering license clause, your contribution must be licensed as Apache-2.0.
